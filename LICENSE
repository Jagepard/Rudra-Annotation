------------------

2.1. Grants
    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license:

    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
        trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce,
        make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and
        otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified
        basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell,
        offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer
        either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date
    The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any
    Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the
    Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted
    under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be
    implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software
    under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no
    patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered
        Software; or

    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third
        party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the
        combination of its Contributions with other software (except
        as part of the Contributor Version); or

    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
        absence of its Contributions.

    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service
    marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to
    comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses
    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice
    to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of
    this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary
    License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form
    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including
    any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must
    be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that
    the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the
    terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this
    License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict their rights
    under this License.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source
        Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform
        recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy
        of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely
        manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to
        the recipient; and

    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of
        this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided
        that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form
        under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your
    choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this
    License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a
    combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more
    Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible
    With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally
    distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
    License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their
    option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
    either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices
    You may not remove or alter the notices in the Source Code Form
    stating that the file is governed by this License, or the notices
    in Exhibit A (if present). You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit
    A in each file of the Source Code Form. If a file does not have
    such a notice, You may add one.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must:
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License.

5. Termination
-------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License will be
automatically reinstated.

5.2. Upon termination, You do not receive any additional rights from
Contributors. However, You may continue to use, distribute, and
modify Covered Software that You received prior to termination,
provided that You comply with all terms of this License.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN
ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT ANY CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR,
OR ANYONE WHO DISTRIBUTES COVERED SOFTWARE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of
that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law
provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability
to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. If any provision of this License
is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this License
will remain in full force and effect.

10. Versions of the License
--------------------------

10.1. New Versions
    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in
    Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right
    to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version
    will be given a distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions
    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the
    version of the License under which You originally received the
    Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version
    published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions
    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want
    to create a new license for such software, you may create and use
    a modified version of this License if you rename the license and
    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except
    to note that such modified license differs from this License).

11. Patents
-----------

A Contributor is not required to grant patent licenses to any entity
that asserts a patent infringement claim against the Contributor.
